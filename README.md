## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

# About me: Sanika (she/her)
- I'm a **3rd year CS and Data Science student** at the University of Virginia.
- I am a **TA for CS 2100 - Data Structures and Algorithms 1.**
- I'm not exactly sure what I want to do after I graduate, so I'm trying to **explore everything I want to with the time that I have!**
- When I'm not working on one of my many assignments or personal projects, I like to **draw** and **make bracelets!**
- Contrary to what my profile picture indicates, I'm a **human**, not a cat!

# Some of my projects:
- **Generative AI Evaluation Dashboard:** I worked with 2nd Order solutions through ML@UVA to build an dashboard to compare LLM performance (using metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore, ChrF) and display the results through interactive data visualizations.
- **AIRDROBE:** I developed a Django-based website for UVA students to swap, borrow and rate clothes. This website was my CS 3240 final project!
- **Eggs by the Dozen, A New Approach to Parasite Egg Detection:** I created a rules-based computer vision algorithm in to automate the process of calculating a ruminant's fecal egg count.
- See my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rOFxf_OCpP7V4m8aWphKy199RFH-RCgDk-7rik-gLoA/edit?usp=sharing) for more!
